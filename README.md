**IBM CICS TS Operator collection**
========================

The **IBM® CICS® TS Operator collection** provides automation for provisioning CICS TS on one or more z/OS endpoints and managing its lifecycle in a hybrid cloud environment.


Import this collection into an instance of **z/OS® Cloud Broker** running in Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform to get started quickly. **z/OS Cloud Broker** generates a Kubernetes operator, making it easy to deploy CICS TS to a z/OS endpoint.
